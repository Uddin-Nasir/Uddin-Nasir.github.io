<strong>Title:</strong> Brain Structural and Functional Connectome in HIV-Associated Neuroinflammation (PI: Schifitto)

<strong>Major Goals:</strong> The goal of this study is to assess the longitudinal changes in the trajectory of brain structural connectome and functional connectivity in HIV infected compared to HIV seronegative individuals and to assess the mediation effect of structural connectome, functional connectivity and cerebral cortical thickness on specific cognitive domains.

<strong>Title:</strong> Study of Metformin to reduce cerebrovascular dysfunction in South African patients with HIV and metabolic syndrome: A phase II pilot trial: SMART (MPI: Decloedt, Schifitto)

<strong>Major Goals:</strong> The goals of this study are to obtain preliminary data on the effect of metformin on cerebral vascular reactivity and cerebral blood flow in HIV positive participants with metabolic syndrome and to assess whether metformin associated changes in cerebral vascular reactivity and cerebral blood flow are mediated via improvements in endothelial function.

<strong>Title:</strong> Brain Structural Biomarkers of Risk and Resilience to Pain Chronification (PI: Geha)

<strong>Major Goals:</strong> This application aims to identify structural gray and white matter biomarkers of risk and
resilience to pain chronification after the onset of low-back pain by testing specific hypotheses based on existing knowledge of chronic pain and the brain while at the same time addressing the influence of sex and types of clinical presentations (i.e., presence or absence of sciatica).
