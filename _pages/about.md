Hi! Iâ€™m Nasir, a Research Assistant Professor at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), New York in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/neurology.aspx). I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), my MSc in Physics at [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://www.mun.ca/) and my BSc in Physics at [Jahangirnagar University](https://www.juniv.edu/). 

## Research
My research interests lie at the intersection of MRI physics and neuroscience, and my overall research vision is to understand human brain structure and function in healthy and diseased states. Specifically, some of my interests and expertise include : 1) developing MRI methods and image processing pipelines; 2) investigating neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration via diffusion MRI methods such as free water imaging (FWI), neurite orientation and density imaging (NODDI) and b-tensor encoding, and T2 based myelin water imaging (MWI); 3) investigating iron sensitive measures to find potential biomarkers using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and relaxometry mappings (T2, T2*); 4) investigating the relationship between structural and functional MRI measures and cognitive performance in both healthy, aging and diseased populations(e.g., Multiple Sclerosis, HIV, Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Stroke, Parkison's Disease, and Hypertension).
