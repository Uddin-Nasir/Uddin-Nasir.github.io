I‚Äôm an Assistant Professor at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), New York in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/neurology.aspx) and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/bme/). My journey in academia and research has been dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the human brain through multmodal MRI techniques. I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) under Professor [Alan Wilman](https://www.ualberta.ca/biomedical-engineering/research/peter-s-allen-mr-research-centre/research-team/dr-alan-wilman.html)'s supervision in December 2015. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. Honours and M.Sc. in physics, which provided a solid foundation for my current research pursuits. 

## Research Overview
My research interests lie at the fascinating intersection of MRI physics and neuroscience, where I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of the human brain's structure and function in both healthy and diseased states. 

üåü Some of my key interests and areas of expertise include: üåü

1Ô∏è‚É£ Developing cutting-edge MRI methods and image processing pipelines to enhance brain imaging accuracy.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Unraveling Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration via Diffusion MRI Methods, and T2-based myelin water imaging to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Investigating Iron-Sensitive Measures such as quantitative susceptibility mapping and relaxometry mappings to identify iron-sensitive measures that could serve as promising biomarkers for neurodegenerative processes in the brain.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Probing Vascular Dysfunction through Advanced MRI Techniques such as perfusion MRI and resting-state fMRI-based cerebrovascular reactivity. Additionally, I am delving into vascular remodeling using time-of-flight MR Angiography, with the exciting aim of developing an automated AI-based approach for the segmentation and classification of brain arteries and extracting essential vascular features.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Exploring the relationship between structural and functional MRI measures, blood markers and cognitive performance in diverse populations, including healthy individuals, aging individuals, and those affected by neurological conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, HIV, CSVD, Stroke, Parkinson's Disease, and Hypertension.

In addition, I serve as an Academic Editor for PLOS One, and hold esteemed roles as a Guest Associate Editor and Review Editor for Frontiers in Neurology.
