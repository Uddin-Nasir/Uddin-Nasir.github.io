{% include base_path %}

I’m an Assistant Professor at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), New York in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/neurology.aspx) and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/bme/). My journey in academia and research has been dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the human brain through multmodal MRI techniques. I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) under Professor [Alan Wilman](https://www.ualberta.ca/biomedical-engineering/research/peter-s-allen-mr-research-centre/research-team/dr-alan-wilman.html)'s supervision in December 2015. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. Honours and M.Sc. in physics, which provided a solid foundation for my current research pursuits. 

## Research Focus
With more than 12 years of invaluable experience in the field, my research interests converge at the thrilling intersection of MRI physics and neuroscience. My ultimate goal is to advance our comprehension of the human brain's structure and function, both in its healthy state and when afflicted by various diseases. My expertise and interests span a wide range of captivating topics, including:

# Developing Advanced MRI Methods: 
My passion lies in actively contributing to the development of cutting-edge MRI methods, enabling precise visualization and quantification of neuroinflammation and neuronal injury. Additionally, I am focused on refining image processing pipelines to extract meaningful information from complex MRI datasets.

# Investigating Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration:
Through pioneering the innovative use of diffusion MRI methods, such as free water imaging (FWI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), and b-tensor encoding, I strive to gain deeper insights into neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative processes. My exploration also extends to leveraging T2-based myelin water imaging (MWI) and multifrequency MR Elastography as valuable tools for these investigations.

# Exploring Iron-Sensitive Measures: 
My work actively involves researching potential biomarkers using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and relaxometry mappings (T2, T2*, T2’) to better understand the pivotal role of iron in brain health and disease.

# Investigating Vascular Dysfunction: 
My passion extends to studying vascular dysfunction through perfusion MRI and resting-state fMRI-based cerebrovascular reactivity. Additionally, I am delving into vascular remodeling using time-of-flight MR Angiography, with the exciting aim of developing an automated AI-based approach for the segmentation and classification of brain arteries and extracting essential vascular features with minimum training datasets.

# Linking Structural and Functional MRI Measures: 
My endeavors encompass meticulously analyzing the relationship between structural and functional MRI measures, blood markers, and cognitive performance across diverse populations, embracing healthy individuals, aging populations, and those impacted by various clinical conditions.

# Research Background:
During my enriching Ph.D. journey, I specialized in the development of MRI methods and their application to evaluating brain iron levels and track disease progression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using a high-field MRI scanner (4.7 T human scanner). As a devoted research associate at the University of Manitoba, I continued this line of investigation, employing an array of structural and functional MRI techniques (T2*, QSM, diffusion MRI, MWI, and resting-state fMRI) on a clinical Siemens 3T scanner. My tenure at the University of Rochester has been equally rewarding, as I actively contribute to several local and NIH-funded studies, focusing on a diverse range of neurological disorders, including HIV, Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Stroke, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's disease, brain tumors, and Hypertension.
