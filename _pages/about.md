I‚Äôm an Assistant Professor at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), New York in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/neurology.aspx) and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/bme/). My journey in academia and research has been dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the human brain through multimodal MRI techniques. I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) under Professor [Alan Wilman](https://www.ualberta.ca/biomedical-engineering/research/peter-s-allen-mr-research-centre/research-team/dr-alan-wilman.html)'s supervision in December 2015. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. Honours and M.Sc. in physics, which provided a solid foundation for my current research pursuits. 

## Research Overview
My research interests lie at the fascinating intersection of MRI physics and neuroscience, where I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of the human brain's structure and function in both healthy and diseased states. 

üåü Some of my key interests and areas of expertise include: üåü

1Ô∏è‚É£ Developing cutting-edge MRI methods and image processing pipelines to enhance brain imaging accuracy.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Unraveling neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration via diffusion MRI, and myelin water imaging and iron-sensitive MRI methods to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Probing vascular dysfunction through advanced MR imaging and angiography techniques.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploring the relationship between structural and functional MRI measures and investigating their clinical correlations in both healthy and diseased human brains. 

In addition, I serve as an Academic Editor for PLOS One and hold esteemed roles as a Guest Associate Editor and Review Editor for Frontiers in Neurology.
