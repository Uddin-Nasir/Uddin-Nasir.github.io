I’m an Assistant Professor at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), New York in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/neurology.aspx) and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/bme/). I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), my MSc in Physics at [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://www.mun.ca/) and my BSc in Physics honours at [Jahangirnagar University](https://www.juniv.edu/). 

## Research
I have been working on multimodal MRI of the human brain for more than 11 years. My research interests lie at the intersection of MRI physics and neuroscience, and my overall research vision is to understand human brain structure and function in healthy and diseased states. Specifically, some of my interests and expertise include : 1) developing MRI methods for neuroinflammation/neuronal injury and image processing pipelines; 2) investigating neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration via diffusion MRI methods (such as free water imaging FWI, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging NODDI, and b-tensor encoding), T2 based myelin water imaging MWI, and multifrequency MR Elastography; 3) investigating iron sensitive measures to find potential biomarkers using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and relaxometry mappings (T2, T2*, T2’); 4) investigating vascular dysfunction via perfusion MRI and resting state fMRI based cerebrovascular reactivity, as well as vascular remodeling using time of flight MR Angiography; and 5) investigating the relationship between structural and functional MRI measures, blood markers and cognitive performance in both healthy, aging and clinical populations. My previous and current research experiences have laid the foundation for these goals. 

My PhD thesis combined the development of MRI methods and their applications for evaluating brain iron and tracking disease progression and state in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using high field MRI (4.7 T human scanner). As a research associate at the University of Manitoba, I continued this line of research using a range of structural and functional MRI methods (T2*, QSM, diffusion MRI, MWI, and resting state fMRI) using a clinical Siemens 3T. At the University of Rochester, I have been involved in several local and NIH funded studies for several disorders including HIV, Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Stroke, Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s disease, brain tumor, and Hypertension.
